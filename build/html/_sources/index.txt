ATpy documentation
======================

ATpy is a high-level package providing a way to treat tables of data with a uniform and consistent API. A table is defined by any number of columns of data, each characterized by a column name, unit, null value, and description (the last three being optional), and can be supplemented with metadata in the form of keywords or comments. ATpy can be used to manipulate single tables as well as sets of tables.
